# javascript-for-beginner

30 days challanges to code in js. Beginner friendly, you can find it easily here. It's not for the advance one. If you are already familiar with this thingy, then just skip it. Unless if you want to re-learning, then it's okei.

It's okei to skip one or two days, we also need a rest. Sometimes playing is also good, kalian harus selalu berusaha
agar nantinya bisa menjadikan kamu sebagai insan cendiki
